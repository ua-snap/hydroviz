These simulations were developed to provide estimates of the water budget and statistics of streamflow for historical and potential future conditions using atmospheric forcing data from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Specific file types include: 1) input forcings of minimum air temperature, maximum air temperature, and daily precipitation derived from general circulation models (GCM, table1_GCMs_used.csv), 2) output files of simulated streamflow for each stream segment in the model, 3) GIS files of the model hydrologic response units and stream segments, and 4) a suite of streamflow statistics for each modeled segment. This data release complements data release (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9CVHLMB) which contains historical simulations based on historically observed atmospheric forcings rather than GCM-derived forcings. The same parameter files and model configuration files were used for all model runs and are available in that data release.",
