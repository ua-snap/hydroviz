    "\n",
    "Use this notebook to add some hydrologic statistic attributes to the segments shapefile. These stats are a subset of the full dataset designed for quick display on the webapp via WMS / WFS. Generally, we are trying to **show the difference between historical (Maurer) and a model ensemble for the RCP 8.5 scenario in the late-century era.**\n",
