    "## 3. Find streams at HUC outlets\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this notebook to find the streams that occur the farthest downstream in a given HUC. We need to use the full National Hydrologic Model Geospatial Fabric for this, since it has the to/from flow attributes populated. We will then crosswalk back to our project stream network to add attributes denoting if a stream is a HUC outlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each NHM-GF stream has a `tosegment` attribute with the ID of the next downstream segment. If we list all stream IDs occuring in a given HUC polygon, and also list the `tosegment` stream IDs, the stream that has a `tosegment` value that is not the the full list of HUC streams should be the furthest downstream segment. In other words, if a stream flows to a stream that is not in the HUC, it must be flowing out of the HUC and therefore is the furthest downstream.\n",
